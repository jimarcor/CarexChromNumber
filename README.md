These files correspond to the supplementary material of the paper published in *Journal of Systematics and Evolution* entitled "Macroevolutionary insights in sedges (*Carex*: Cyperaceae): The effects of rapid chromosome evolution and transitions in chromosomal optimum on lineage diversification" (doi: __).

- Data S1. Summary stats of the species with chromosome data vs. the accepted species by lineage and the most recent species with molecular data available (Roalson et al., 2020). List of taxa used in the study with chromosome number, morphological and bioclimatic data. This list contains only those taxa used in Martín-Bravo et al. (2019) that also present chromosome number reports available.

- Data S2. Results from chromosome number evolution models comparison using R package motmot (Harmon & Freckleton, 2008).

- Data S3. Zip file including the script file used for bayou analysis (Uyeda & Harmon, 2014) and the output summary and figures for chromosome number (diploid), culm length (cm), lateral inflorescence length (mm), annual mean temperature (BIO1, ºCx10), temperature seasonality (standard deviation x 100), temperature annual range (BIO7, ºCx10) and annual precipitation (BIO12, mm).

- Data S4. Zip file including the script file used for QuaSSE analysis (FitzJohn, 2012) and the table showing the different models results.

- Data S5. Log-likelihood space in function of phylogenetic signals (t1/2) and stationary variances (vy) for each studied model with slouch (Kopperud et al., 2018).

- Figure S1. Dendrogram for hierarchical clustering with the 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables labeled.
